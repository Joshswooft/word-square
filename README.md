# Word Square Challenge

This challenge is to produce a word square. In a word square you are given a grid with letters
arranged that spell valid English language words when you read from left to right or from top to
bottom, with the requirement that the words you spell in each column and row of the same
number are the same word. For example, the first row and the first column spell the same
word, the second row and second column do, too, and so on. The challenge is that in arranging
those letters that you spell valid words that meet those requirements.
One variant is where you're given an n\*n grid and asked to place a set of letters inside to meet
these rules, and thatâ€™s our challenge: given the grid dimensions and a list of letters, can you
produce a valid word square.
